Texas Instruments Software License Agreement
============================================

Important - Read carefully.  If you do not agree with the following terms you may not use the software programs or associated documentation for any purpose: This Software License Agreement (or "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or entity) and Texas Instruments Incorporated ("TI").  The "Licensed Materials" subject to this Agreement include the downloadable software programs and documentation that accompany this Agreement and any "on-line" or electronic documentation associated with the software programs.  Any applications included with the "Licensed Materials" are specifically designed and licensed for execution solely and exclusively on semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI.  By installing, copying or otherwise using the Licensed Materials, you agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement.  

This Agreement is displayed for you to read prior to downloading and using the Licensed Materials.  If you choose not to agree with these provisions, do not download or install the Licensed Materials.  

1.      Intellectual Property, Title and Limited License Grant - The Licensed Materials are protected by copyright laws, international copyright treaties, and trade secret laws, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties.  The Licensed Materials are licensed, not sold to you, and can only be used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  TI retains title and ownership of the Licensed Materials, including all intellectual property rights in the Licensed Materials and all copies of the Licensed Materials.

a.      Host License - Subject to the terms of this Agreement, TI hereby grants to you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Licensed Materials to generate applications that execute solely and exclusively on semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI.  Use of any software applications generated using the Licensed Materials on semiconductor devices manufactured by or for an entity other than TI is a material breach of this Agreement.  It is also a material breach of this license to use the Licensed Materials to assist in the design, development or verification of a device that is instruction set compatible with, or functionally equivalent to, a TI semiconductor device.  
	
b.      Target License - The Licensed Materials may include TI proprietary software programs in an object code format that are designed specifically for use in target applications.  TI hereby grants to you a limited, non-exclusive license to reproduce and distribute an unlimited number of copies of such programs solely and exclusively for use with semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI.  The Licensed Materials may also include libraries or applications software in a source code format.  You may use these programs to create modified or derivative programs that may be reproduced and distributed by you provided that such programs execute solely and exclusively on semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI and provided further that such programs are distributed only in an object code or executable format.  You may not distribute, publish, rent, lease or sub-license the Licensed Materials, or any portion or derivative thereof, in a source code format or transfer or assign this Agreement without TI's prior written permission.   
 
c.      Termination - This license is effective until terminated.  Without prejudice to any other rights, TI may terminate your right to use the Licensed Materials and any applications generated using the Licensed Materials under this Agreement if you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement.  In such event, you shall destroy all copies of the Licensed Materials, including all portions and derivatives thereof, in your possession, custody or control.

2.      Intellectual Property Rights - The Licensed Materials contain copyrighted material, trade secrets and other proprietary information.  In order to protect the Licensed Materials, and except as specifically permitted by statute by a provision that cannot be waived by contract, you may not unlock, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or otherwise translate any binary or object code versions of the software programs included in the Licensed Materials to human-perceivable form.  You also agree that you will use your best efforts to prevent your employees and contractors from unlocking, decompiling, reverse engineering, disassembling, modifying or translating the Licensed Materials.  In no event may you alter, remove or destroy any copyright notice included in the Licensed Materials.  TI reserves all rights not specifically granted under this Agreement.

3.      Upgrades, Updates and Plug-ins - If the Licensed Materials are labeled as an upgrade, update or plug-in you must be properly licensed to use the product identified by TI as being eligible for such upgrade, update or plug-in to use the Licensed Materials.  An upgrade, update, or plug-in replaces or supplements a previously licensed eligible product.  You may use the resulting upgraded product only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and only to generate applications for use with semiconductor devices manufactured by or for TI.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Agreement will be construed as an obligation for TI to maintain or support the Licensed Materials or to provide upgrades, updates or plug-ins to the Licensed Materials.

7.      Entire Agreement - This is the entire Agreement between you and TI and supercedes any prior agreement between the parties related to the subject matter of this Agreement.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of TI.
